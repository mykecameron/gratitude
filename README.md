# Gratitude: a daily gratitude log

## What is this?

This is a toy project I built to simulate my dead trees gratitude log with a
simple webapp. I implemented this project using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
as an excuse to play with the framework and get a feel for working with it.

The app prompts you to respond to a gratitude prompt, and saves the responses
in browser `localStorage`, so that you can revisit them later.
