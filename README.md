# Gratitude: a daily gratitude log

## What is this?

This is a toy project I built to simulate my dead trees gratitude log with a
simple webapp. I implemented this project using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
as an excuse to play with the framework and get a feel for working with it.

The app prompts you to respond to a gratitude prompt, and saves the responses
in browser `localStorage`, so that you can revisit them later.

You can see it in action at https://mykecameron.github.io/gratitude/.

## How to run it

Check out the repo, then run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

To serve a development server, run `yarn serve`. To build for production run
`yarn build`.

Github Pages deployment can be triggered by running `yarn deploy`.
